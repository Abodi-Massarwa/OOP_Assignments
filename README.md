#   Assignment Summary 

__

_In this assignment we are implementing a graph with an optimized functionality over 2d matrix graph._

_Methods that the graph support are addNode(node), connectEdge(node1, ndoe2), edgeSize(node), getNode(Key) in O(1)._

_More methods like removeEdge(node1, node2) is executed in O(1) & removeNode(node1) is executed in O(N) ._

_There is also a graph wrapper utility class (i.e. Graph_Algo) which supports more useful functionalities such as is the graph connected & finds the shortest path between 2 nodes._
