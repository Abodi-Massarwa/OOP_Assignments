#   Assignment_1 Summary 

__

_In this assignment we modified the fundemental fundtions (shortest path & is connected ) and supported this funtionality though adding weighted edges_

_in addition we implemented JUnit test cases for the desired classes to prove the correctness and durability of our algorithms under heavy usage_

_we used the well-known Dijekstra algorithm to replace BFS algorithm especially in shortest path functions_

_it worths mentioning that we also implemented the LOAD & SAVE functions in graph algo class that would help us save and initialize the graph using files saved in our Drive with respect to serializeable interface implementation_

# Assignment 1 main classes
1)  _WGraph_DS- implements weighted_graph and node_info interfaces_
2)  _WGraph_Algo- implements weighted_graph_algorithms interface_

# Previously

_Methods that the graph support are addNode(node), connectEdge(node1, ndoe2), edgeSize(node), getNode(Key) in O(1)._

_More methods like removeEdge(node1, node2) is executed in O(1) & removeNode(node1) is executed in O(N) ._

_There is also a graph wrapper utility class (i.e. Graph_Algo) which supports more useful functionalities such as is the graph connected & finds the shortest path between 2 nodes._
